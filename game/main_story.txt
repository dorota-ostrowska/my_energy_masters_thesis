The virtual realm of Eneroth was once a vibrant and energetic place. However, pollution and excessive energy consumption caused it to weaken. At that time, a group of heroes called the Eco Guardians arrived in the realm, recruiting its inhabitants and imparting the secret power of energy conservation. Their mission is to restore Eneroth to its former glory by reducing energy consumption and promoting ecological actions. Users join the Eco Guardians as Energy Wizards, tasked with collecting magical energy points by saving electricity and undertaking eco-friendly activities. The more points they gather, the more powerful ecological spells they will be able to cast upon the city.
