At that time, a group of heroes called the Eco Guardians 🦸🦸‍♀️ arrived in the realm, recruiting its inhabitants and imparting the secret power of energy conservation 🌱✨. Their mission is to restore Eneroth 🌍 to its former glory by reducing energy consumption and promoting ecological actions ⚡. Users join the Eco Guardians as Energy Wizards 🧙🧙‍♀️, tasked with collecting magical energy points by saving electricity and undertaking eco-friendly activities 💡🔋.
